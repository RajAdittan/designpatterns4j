Learn to code design patterns in Java.
The patterns are presented as follows;

1. Creational
    - Singleton
        - Disable object creation of the Singleton class and ensure only one instance exist and accessible in current VM.
    - Prototype
        - Avoid creating object from scratch instead make copies from a known good state of the class instance.
2. Behavioral
    - Observer
        - Notify one ore more registered observers up on changes in the observable.
    - Template
        - Create a template method to perform repeated operations.
    - Mediator
        - Allow a middleware object to control supplier and consumer needs.
    - Command
        - Create and execute irreversible action.
3. Structural
    - Adapter
        - Make two or more unrelated interfaces to work together.
    - Proxy
        - Provide a surrogate to one or more instances of a class thereby controlling access to instances.
    - Facade
        - Provide simplified client interface to hide complex interactions between various objects.
